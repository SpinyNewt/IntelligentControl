This repository includes assignments of the Course `Intelligent Control Technique`

## HW1: Hierarchical Control

Hierarchical control is a structured approach that divides the control system into multiple levels, each with distinct functions and responsibilities, to achieve efficient and coordinated operation. 

This project focuses on the hierarchical control system for a multi-robot collaborative system, which enables robots to complete complex tasks such as picking up bolts and installing nuts in an unstructured environment.

## HW2: Expert Control System

==Expert control== systems use predefined rules and heuristics based on expert knowledge to adapt control strategies dynamically, optimizing performance in complex or uncertain conditions. 

This project explores the dynamics of a ==cart-inverted pendulum system== and implements an incremental discrete PID controller based on expert control to stabilize the system and improve its performance.

## HW3: Fuzzy Control

==Fuzzy control== uses fuzzy logic to convert precise inputs into fuzzy variables, apply rules for reasoning, and then return precise outputs, effectively managing uncertainties and nonlinearities. 

This project designs and implements a fuzzy control system for a ==magnetic levitation system== to maintain a steel ball at a desired position by optimizing the control voltage using fuzzy PID control, achieving stable and accurate control performance.

## HW4: Neural Network System Identification

==Neural network system identification== uses artificial neural networks to model complex systems by learning from input-output data, suitable for nonlinear and dynamic systems. 

This project applies neural network system identification to model a ==two-degree-of-freedom robotic arm==, comparing two approaches for predicting its angular response based on different input data types.

## Assignment: Emergency Lane Change Control Scheme for Autonomous Vehicles

This project explores various control methods for autonomous vehicle emergency lane change, including fuzzy control, fuzzy PID, neural network PID, and adaptive control.
